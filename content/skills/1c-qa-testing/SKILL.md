# 1c-qa-testing — UI checks through QA MCP

QA MCP (connection `1c-qa`) is the 1C test manager: it connects to a 1C test client (`/TestClient`) and drives its forms through the platform testing model — windows, fields, tables, commands, messages. It reads structured state, not pixels, so it is the main route for checking behaviour in the 1C interface. The web client (`content/rules/ui-testing-tools.md`) is the fallback.

## When this route applies

All of these hold:

- `UI_TESTING` allows the check (`content/rules/dev-standards-env.md → UI_TESTING`): `essential` / `auto` after the change reached the dev/test infobase, `manual` on an explicit request, never under `off`.
- `TOOL_QA` is not `off` (`content/rules/mcp-policy.md → Tool availability`).
- The `qa_*` / `ui_*` tools are exposed in this session and `qa_status` answers. A config entry or `/healthz` proves nothing.
- The target is an authorized dev/test infobase (`INFOBASE_ROLE`), the one in `.dev.env`.

Otherwise use the web fallback of `ui-testing-tools.md`, or report the check unrun with the reason. `TOOL_QA=required` with the server missing blocks the check; the web client does not replace it.

**Before the first action load `content/rules/qa-testclient.md`.** It owns what the server does not do: starting and stopping the test client, visible or hidden window, screenshots, Windows-MCP, and confirming data through `1c-data-mcp`. Tool argument names come from the exposed schemas; `qa_playbook` returns the sequence for the current executor.

## Other MCP servers in a check

When a check needs metadata, form structure, impact, error source or live data, load the matching entry in [context-sources.md](docs/context-sources.md). Use indexes only when they cover the configuration loaded into the tested infobase; confirm element names in the live window.

## Session

1. `qa_status` — the executor decides who starts 1C:

   | `executor` | What it is | Test client |
   |---|---|---|
   | `native` | The container is the test manager and speaks the test-client protocol; no 1C platform inside | The agent starts it by `qa-testclient.md`; the server only connects |
   | `platform` | Windows manager next to the platform | `qa_start` starts it itself |

2. Start or find the test client (`qa-testclient.md`), then `qa_start(connection="<session name>")`; `port=` overrides the port of `MCP_QA_TESTCLIENT`. No Windows account is needed: the test client accepts the channel's Windows authentication from any identity (8.3.27.2130); the 1C sign-in happens when the client starts.
3. `qa_status` again: executor, link, target. A `test client is already connected to another manager` answer means another agent owns the client — a conflict to resolve, not a client to close.
4. At the end: `qa_stop`. In `native` it only disconnects; the client is closed by the tool that started it (`qa-testclient.md`). A new MCP session or a restarted client needs a new `qa_start`; `save_as` aliases and `ui_here` pins do not survive it.

After `/update1cbase`, `/deploy-and-test` or `/restore-testbase` the update ends the sessions of the infobase: a client started before it is stale. Start a fresh client, `qa_start`, and read the main window before the first step.

## Observe → act → read the change → assert

1. Read before acting: `ui_active_window`, then `ui_window_tree(detail="lite")` or `ui_inspect`. Use the names and paths they return; never invent element names.
2. One purposeful action: `ui_open`, `ui_click`, `ui_set` / `ui_input`, `ui_field`, `ui_table`, `ui_list`, `ui_command`, `ui_dialog`, `ui_form`.
3. Read the result: `ui_window_changes`, `ui_wait` (form, element or closing), `ui_messages`, `ui_errors`.
4. Assert on read values: `ui_get_text`, `ui_find`, table rows from `ui_table` / `ui_list`. A command accepted is not an effect observed.
5. Re-read the window after navigation, a closed form or anything that invalidates the tree; earlier snapshots and `ui_here` pins are stale then.

The first form may still be loading right after the client starts: repeat read-only reads within a bounded wait.

### Forms

- `ui_open(kind=, metadata_name=)` without `form_name` opens and recognises the default form, including one defined in the configuration (`Вид.Объект.Форма.<Имя>`). When the configuration opens another form instead (ZUP: the employee list is a data-processor form), the single new form is accepted and the answer carries `substituted_for`. A failed open lists the forms that did appear. `ui_open(link="e1cib/…", target_title=…)` opens by navigation link.
- `e1cib/data/<Type>.<Name>` without `?ref` opens a new object; the auto-generated object form is `<Type>.<Name>.ФормаОбъекта`, without `.Форма.`.
- `ui_close_form` closes the named form (`form=`, `title=`, `name=`, `form_name=`) or the active non-main window. It never closes the main window and closes nothing when the named form is not found.
- The MCPQAClient extension enables `ui_form_schema`, `qa_data_candidates` and `ui_open` through `ОткрытьФорму`; without it `ui_open` opens forms by navigation link. Installing it is a change of the test infobase (`qa-testclient.md → MCPQAClient extension`).

## Recipes

Before list navigation, field entry, table editing, save/post or dialog actions, read the matching recipe and its pitfalls in [interaction-recipes.md](docs/interaction-recipes.md). Read-only window inspection needs no recipe. Two failed attempts by one method require a fresh window read, then another method or an explicit unverified result; never vary arguments blindly.

## Platform behaviour (8.3.27.2130, measured)

Before asserting changed field values, navigating table rows/tabs, writing/posting, deleting, or diagnosing a lost link/message, read the relevant behaviour in [platform-behaviour.md](docs/platform-behaviour.md). Command acceptance never proves the effect; the unknown-outcome rules below always apply.

## Unknown outcome

- A timed-out or interrupted action has an unknown outcome: it may have written data. Never repeat a save, post, delete or command blindly.
- Call `qa_command_status` (`channel="client"` for the extension). In `native` a failed link blocks new calls until `qa_command_status` acknowledges it; then `qa_reconnect(force=True)` and read the window (`ui_window_tree`) before deciding.
- A read that times out is not repeated in a loop either; follow the same path.

## Test journal and verdicts

Keep a journal of every check so that another session can continue it after a crash, a lost link or a context reset. A one-off request to open or show something — no change under check, no data written — needs no journal and no screenshot: answer with what was read.

- Where: the task's output directory; otherwise `%TEMP%\qa-runs\<YYYY-MM-DD>-<short name>\journal.md`. Screenshots go next to it. Give the path in the report.
- Write it as you go, after each step:
  - header: scenario, infobase and its role, executor, test-client port, window mode (visible / hidden), start time;
  - per step: number, tool and key arguments, what was observed, verdict, evidence (tool answer or screenshot path);
  - test data the check created (object kind, number or code, key fields, why), written when created;
  - one state line: active window, open dialogs or unsaved changes, whether the client is alive.
- To continue: read the journal, `qa_status` (`qa_reconnect(force=True)` if the link is gone), read the window, go on from the first step without a verdict. Repeat a data-changing step only when the journal and the data show it did not happen.
- Verdict per step: `passed` / `failed` / `not verified`, each with evidence.
  - Evidence: a value read back, an error text from `ui_errors`, the form name of the window that opened, a message text, a data read through `1c-data-mcp`, or a screenshot — whichever shows the result better.
  - An answer that only confirms the command was sent (`clicked`, `added`, `deleted`, `ok`) is not evidence of its effect. A step without evidence is `not verified`, never `passed`.
- Quote messages and error texts verbatim, in the interface language.
- An unplanned refusal that blocks the next steps: record the step `failed` with the text, mark the rest `not verified`, and stop.
- Expected numbers belong in the scenario; a number the agent calculates goes into the journal with the calculation.
- Reuse test data from earlier runs (see the journal) before creating new. Delete test data only when the person asks.

## Not available in `native`

`qa_setup` and `qa_install_client` answer `executor_capability`. `ui_eval` / `qa_run_script` are replaced by `1c-data-mcp`, `ui_screenshot` and the hidden desktop by the Windows side of `qa-testclient.md`. Do not emulate anything else; report the gap. A tool that is missing from the list is not replaced by `ui_eval` or another workaround.

## Report

Use the scenario and report templates of `content/agents/tester.md`. Name the route (`QA MCP`, executor), the infobase, the journal path, the screenshots by step number, every step whose outcome was not confirmed, and data checks done or not done. Transport success, `/healthz` or a tool list is not a passing check.
