# Tool policy and runtime availability

All availability-driven routing checks BOTH policy and runtime. **Exposed** describes the live tool schema; exposure alone never overrides policy. Before selecting tools, read applicable `TOOL_*` keys in `.dev.env`; names: `content/rules/dev-standards-env.md → Tool policy`. Commands, skills and subagents inherit this filter, including instructions phrased as «when exposed/connected».

- `auto` (missing / empty default): use eligible tools; on absence or failure follow the operation's documented fallback.
- `off`: do not call, probe, recommend installing, or bypass the provider through aliases, HTTP or CLI. Record `disabled by policy` when it affects required evidence; then use the documented fallback.
- `required`: when task/depth/routing selects this provider, it must supply the needed capability. Missing tools, failed calls or unsuitable scope block that step; alternatives can gather context but cannot satisfy it. Continue independent work. Do not downgrade or auto-install. This does not invoke unrelated providers, inactive workflows or already-unneeded fallbacks.
- An invalid non-empty value leaves that provider's dependent step blocked until corrected; never interpret a typo as permission. Settings are case-insensitive. Installation/status commands may inspect a disabled tool on explicit request; installation does not change policy. A specific user override applies only to its stated scope.

Runtime evidence is operation-specific: MCP tools must be callable in this session; CLI tools must already exist and run; read and write capabilities are separate. Config entries, healthy endpoints and `required` do not prove capability. Select verified project/layer/IB scope and check freshness before relying on results. Tool failures follow the selected operation's recovery contract; memory uses `project-memory.md`, 1C tools use `mcp-policy.md → C. Server answers → actions`. Re-evaluate after policy, session or target changes; pass policy and evidence to children, which check their own exposed tools.

These switches select execution paths, never waive hard gates. `auto`/`off` fallbacks keep their own limitations: unavailable standards stay unverified/blocked, missing validators require compensating checks, memory falls back locally, metadata/IB/repository tooling gates remain. `USE_EDT` and `UI_TESTING` still decide whether those workflows apply; a tool flag cannot activate them. Report relevant gaps with policy, capability and consequence, distinguishing disabled, absent, failed and wrong/stale scope.
